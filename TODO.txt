TODO:
- possibly convert to use a throwing API
- fix setting default entity duration value (item_entity_ttl) to 900, same as minetest.conf.example
- don't use "on_globalstep" to ensure hit
- remove old textures or change license to CC BY-SA 4.0 to match AiTechEye's licensing
- add Spanish translation
